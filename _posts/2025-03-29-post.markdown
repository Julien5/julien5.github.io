So, minesweeper, interview problem at my job.
The problem is given as follows:

```
Minesweeper C/C++ exercise
1. Generate a NxN Minesweeper-Board with B bombs positioned randomly.
   The parameters N and B are passed as command line arguments.
   N and B are positive integers, B is less than NxN.
  
2. For each position, display the number of bombs in the neighborhood.

Limited Time: 60 minutes.
Clarity and readability of the code will be evaluated first, correctness second.

Example:
$ ./minesweeper 5 2
board:
.*...
..*..
.....
.....
.....

neighbors:
1*21.
12*1.
.111.
.....
.....
```
So, this is just about generating a $$NxN$$ square grid with $$B$$ randomly positioned bombs and count the bombs. This is not about programming the game or solving it. My first version is [here](https://github.com/Julien5/sandbox/blob/ae61a93e049e00a3115cbebe63aea0640fe2a147/test/rust/minesweeper/src/main.rs). (It took me much more than one hour to do that). Nothing very exciting about this exercise, but if you think of (very) large grids, it can get interesting. 

## Generating the bombs

For the $$B$$ randomly positioned bombs, the first idea that comes to mind is the generate random numbers until we have $$B$$ distinct numbers, like this
```
		let mut set=std::collections::HashSet::new();
		while set.len() != B {
			set.insert(rng.random_range(0..N*N));
		}
```
It works, but it make last long if there are many bombs ($$B$$ close to $$N^2$$.. think of the extreme case where the grid is full of bombs). (There is a trick: if $$ B>\frac{N^2}{2} $$ we can invert the logic and generate bomb-free positions instead of bomb positions.) I wanted a fast, deterministic algorithm, privileging [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity) over [space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_complexity) complexity, I choose the [FisherYates shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle) which make $$B$$ *distincts* random numbers out of any $$B$$ random numbers, distincts or not. It has $$O(N^2)$$ space complexity (memory requirement). 

## Counting the bombs

Assuming $$B<\frac{N^2}{2}$$, it is faster to run across bomb positions than to run over all bomb-free positions:
```
	let Bx = distinct_random_numbers(n*n,b);
	for p in &Bx {
		grid[*p]=BOMB;
		increment_neighboors(&mut grid,n,*p);
	}
```
In our first approach, the grid has length $$NxN$$, and we must take care of the edges when iterating over the neighbors positions. This makes quite many `if`s.
```
fn increment_neighboors(grid:&mut [usize], nu:usize, pos:usize) {
	// ...
	for dx in [-1,0,1] {
		let posnx=posx+dx;
		if posnx<0 || posnx>=n {
			continue;
		}
		for dy in [-1,0,1] {
			if dx == 0 && dy == 0 {
				continue
			}
			let posny=posy+dy;
			if posny<0 || posny>=n {
				continue;
			}
			// ...
			// increment the neighboors count
			if grid[lu] != BOMB {
				grid[lu]+=1;
			}
		}
	}
}
```
This quite many `if`s is not very nice. Because of this, and because we want to parallelize, it makes sense to add "margins" to our grid, which gets length $$(N+2)x(N+2)$$. 

## Printing the grid

## Multithreading 

We want to avoid using mutexes as much as possible. The idea is very simple: divide the large minesweeper grids into many small tiles (subgrids) of size $$(X+2)x(Y+2)$$ where $$X=N$$ and $$Y=N/K$$. Each tile as its margin, so that we dont loose neighbors for the bomb on the tile edges. When the tiles are merged together for printing, we must take properly care of those edges. This resulting algorithm is as follows:
1. Determine $$K$$, the number of subgrids. (This could be defined by the user.)
2. For each subgrid, generate a chunk of (an array of) $$B/K$$ bomb positions.
3. For each bomb chunk, generate the tile, placing the bombs and counting the neighbors.
4. Aggregate the tiles together and fix the counts on the tile edges.

Implementation with explicit for loops:
```
fn main(X:usize,Y:usize,Bchunk:usize,K:usize,quiet:bool) {
	let mut tiles=Vec::new();
	for index in 0..K {
		let chunk=BombChunk::with_bomb_count(X,Y,index,Bchunk);
		tiles.push(make_tile(chunk));
	}
	let mut acc=TileAccumulator::init();
	for tile in tiles {
		acc.aggregate(tile);
	}
	let mut printer=make_printer(quiet);
	acc.print_bombs();
	acc.print_counts();
}
```

Reformulated with iterators and [`map`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.map):
```
fn main(X:usize,Y:usize,Bchunk:usize,K:usize,quiet:bool) {
	let mut acc=TileAccumulator::init();
	let _:Vec<()>=(0..K).into_iter()
		.map(|index| BombChunk::with_bomb_count(X,Y,index,Bchunk)).into_iter()
		.map(|chunk| make_tile(chunk)).into_iter()
		.map(|tile| acc.aggregate(tile)).collect();
	acc.print_bombs();
	acc.print_counts();
}
```

And now just replaced iterator with [parallel iterators](https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/iter/index.html):
```
fn main(X:usize,Y:usize,Bchunk:usize,K:usize,quiet:bool) {
	let _:Vec<()>=indexes.into_par_iter()
		.map(|index| BombChunk::with_bomb_count(X,Y,index,Bchunk)).into_par_iter()
		.map(|chunk| make_tile(chunk)).into_par_iter()
		.map(|tile| acc0.lock().unwrap().aggregate(tile))
		.collect();
	acc.print_bombs();
	acc.print_counts();
}
```

**Note**: 
Generating bomb per tile has a "statistical" cost: the probability of the bomb distribution is not uniform over the large grid anymore. For example the probability of any chunk to have more (or less) than $$B/K$$ bombs is zero. At this price we reduce the space complexity.
