So, minesweeper, interview problem at my job.
The problem is given as follows:

```
Minesweeper C/C++ exercise
1. Generate a NxN Minesweeper-Board with B bombs positioned randomly.
   The parameters N and B are passed as command line arguments.
   N and B are positive integers, B is less than NxN.
  
2. For each position, display the number of bombs in the neighborhood.

Limited Time: 60 minutes.
Clarity and readability of the code will be evaluated first, correctness second.

Example:
$ ./minesweeper 5 2
board:
.*...
..*..
.....
.....
.....

neighbors:
1*21.
12*1.
.111.
.....
.....
```
My first version is [here](https://github.com/Julien5/sandbox/blob/ae61a93e049e00a3115cbebe63aea0640fe2a147/test/rust/minesweeper/src/main.rs). (It took me much more than one hour to do that.) The minesweeper board is implemented with a vector of size $$ N=n^2 $$.

{% highlight rust %}
let N = n*n;
let mut grid : Vec<usize> = vec![zero; N];
{% endhighlight %}
