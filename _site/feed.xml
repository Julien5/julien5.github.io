In my case, jealousy is at work and and this blog post is about trying to outdo my coworkers on a small coding challenge we use in interviews. A couple of years ago, each team members gave its best on the coding challenge and my implementation was not the fastest.

<h2 id="minesweeper">Minesweeper</h2>
<p>An image may be better than a thousand words:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/minesweeper/kmines.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The problem is given to the candidates as follows:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Minesweeper C/C++ exercise
1. Generate a NxN's Minesweeper grid with B bombs positioned randomly.
   The parameters N and B are passed as command line arguments.
   N and B are positive integers, B is less than NxN.
  
2. For each position, display the number of bombs in the neighborhood.

Limited Time: 60 minutes.
Clarity and readability of the code will be evaluated first, correctness second.

Example:
$ ./minesweeper 5 2
.*...
..*..
.....
.....
.....

1*21.
12*1.
.111.
.....
.....
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This is just about <strong>generating</strong> a \(NxN\) square grid with \(B\) randomly positioned bombs and count the bombs. This is <strong>not</strong> about programming a playable game or solving it. Nothing very exciting about this exercise, but if you think of (very) large grids, it can get interesting. My first version is <a href="https://github.com/Julien5/sandbox/blob/ae61a93e049e00a3115cbebe63aea0640fe2a147/test/rust/minesweeper/src/main.rs">here</a>.  (As a Rust beginner, it took me well over an hour to get a working prototype.)</p>

<h2 id="baseline-rust-version">Baseline rust version</h2>

<p>The fastest C++ implementation among our team’s C++ solutions is based on an array of length \(NxN\) representing the minesweeper grid, and an array of length \(B\) with the bomb positions. I follow the same approach for the rust implementation. My initial rust version has an array with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">usize</code> elements. The reason for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">usize</code> is the lookup performed in <a href="#printing-the-grid"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print_grid</code></a>, but the element type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">usize</code> is quite large (8 bytes on my PC). (In later versions, I switched to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Vec&lt;u8&gt;</code> for better memory efficiency.) The main function:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>const BOMB  : usize = 9;
const ZERO  : usize = 0;

pub fn main(N : usize, B: usize, quiet: bool) {
	let mut grid : Vec&lt;usize&gt; = vec![ZERO; N*N];
	let Bx = distinct_random_numbers(N * N, B);
	for p in &amp;Bx {
		grid[*p]=BOMB;
		increment_neighboors(&amp;mut grid,N,*p);
	}
	// printing without showing the counts
	print_grid(&amp;grid,N,&amp;mut printer, false);
	// printing with the counts
	print_grid(&amp;grid,N,&amp;mut printer, true);
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="generating-the-bombs">Generating the bombs</h3>

<p>For the \(B\) randomly positioned bombs, the first idea that comes to mind is to generate random numbers until we have \(B\) distinct numbers, like this</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>		let mut set=std::collections::HashSet::new();
		while set.len() != B {
			set.insert(rng.random_range(0..N*N));
		}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>That may be slow if \(B\) is large (close to \(N^2\).. think of the extreme case where the grid is full of bombs). There is a trick: if \(B&gt;\frac{N^2}{2}\) we can invert the logic and generate the bomb-free positions instead of bomb positions.</p>

<p>I wanted a fast, deterministic algorithm that prioritizes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity">time</a> over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_complexity">space</a> complexity, and chose the Fisher–Yates shuffle. This algorithm makes \(B\) <em>distincts</em> random numbers out of any \(B\) random numbers, distincts or not. The tradeoff is that it has \(O(N^2)\) space complexity (memory requirement).</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// in utils.rs
pub fn fisher_yates_shuffle(mut positions: Vec&lt;usize&gt;, B: usize) -&gt; Vec&lt;usize&gt; {
    let mut rng = StdRng::seed_from_u64(3);
    let L = positions.len();
    for i in 0..B {
        let end = L - i;
        let j = rng.random_range(0..end);
        positions.swap(j, end - 1);
    }
    let mut G: Vec&lt;usize&gt; = vec![0; B];
    let end = L;
    for i in 0..B {
        G[i] = positions[end - i - 1];
    }
    G
}
// in baseline.rs
fn distinct_random_numbers(N: usize, B: usize) -&gt; Vec&lt;usize&gt; {
    // populate the available positions excluding the margins.
    let positions: Vec&lt;usize&gt; = (0..N).collect();
    utils::fisher_yates_shuffle(positions, B)
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="counting-the-bombs">Counting the bombs</h3>

<p>Assuming \(B&lt;\frac{N^2}{2}\), it is faster to run across bomb positions than to run over all bomb-free positions:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pub fn main(n : usize, b: usize, quiet: bool) {
	let mut grid : Vec&lt;usize&gt; = vec![ZERO; n*n];
	let Bx = distinct_random_numbers(...);
	for p in &amp;Bx {
		grid[*p]=BOMB;
		increment_neighboors(&amp;mut grid,n,*p);
	}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The grid element has length \(NxN\), and we must take care of the edges when iterating over the neighbors positions. This makes quite many <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code>s.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>fn increment_neighboors(grid:&amp;mut [usize], nu:usize, pos:usize) {
	// ...
	for dx in [-1,0,1] {
		let posnx=posx+dx;
		if posnx&lt;0 || posnx&gt;=n {
			continue;
		}
		for dy in [-1,0,1] {
			if dx == 0 &amp;&amp; dy == 0 {
				continue
			}
			let posny=posy+dy;
			if posny&lt;0 || posny&gt;=n {
				continue;
			}
			// ...
			// increment the neighboors count
			if grid[lu] != BOMB {
				grid[lu]+=1;
			}
		}
	}
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>There are many <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">if</code> branches.</p>

<h3 id="printing-the-grid">Printing the grid</h3>

<p>Printing using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">print!</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">println!</code> is <a href="https://users.rust-lang.org/t/efficiency-of-println-and-format/52772">slow</a>, especially when printing large amounts of data. It is much faster to write bytes directly to standard output. I convert the grid elements to printable characters using a lookup table and print them line by line:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>fn print_grid(grid:&amp;[usize], n:usize, printer : &amp;mut utils::Printer, show_count:bool) {
	let print_lookup: [u8;11] = match show_count {
		true =&gt; {
			[b' ',b'1',b'2',b'3',b'4',b'5',b'6',b'7',b'8',b'*',b' ']
		}
		_ =&gt; {
			[b' ',b' ',b' ',b' ',b' ',b' ',b' ',b' ',b' ',b'*',b' ']
		}
	};
	let mut output:Vec&lt;u8&gt; = prepare_output(n);
	for ky in 0..n {
		for kx in 0..n {
			let k=from_2d((kx,ky),n);
			output[4*kx+2]=print_lookup[grid[k] as usize];
		}
		printer.print(&amp;output);
	}
}
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>The complete code is <a href="https://github.com/Julien5/sandbox/blob/master/test/rust/minesweeper/src/baseline.rs">here</a>. I could not help to make the output more readable with “|” as separators, even if that is a bit slower:</p>

<p><strong>Many Bombs</strong></p>

<p>We populate every two position on the grid with a bomb (\(B=N^2/2\)). Here are the timings for varying grid sizes:</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/minesweeper/time-array-baseline-2.png" alt="tile" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Rust beats C++. Lets try again with less bombs.</p>

<p><strong>Less Bombs</strong></p>

<p>The performance delta gets larger, for example with \(B=N^2/8\):</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/minesweeper/time-array-baseline-8.png" alt="tile" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>I’m not sure why this is happening, and it’s a bit unsettling. I fear there might be an error in the code, but I haven’t been able to identify it. If you spot any issues, please feel free to email me. Perhaps the Rust compiler is simply working harder to optimize, which could explain the increased compilation time. Honestly, I don’t know.</p>

<p>At this point I could call it a day and move on, but I was caught and wanted to make my minesweeper code faster with multithreading. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-00-concurrency.html">Fearless Concurrency</a> is a big selling point of rust.</p>

<h2 id="grid-with-margin">Grid With Margin</h2>

<p>As a first step to a concurrent algorithm, I pad the grid with margins.</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/minesweeper/margins.png" alt="tile" /></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Grid padded with margins</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This will allow us, in the second step, to divide the grid into multiple subgrids that can be process independantly without loosing neighboors counts. By doing so, we avoid the need for mutexes, and as a bonus we can eliminate a couple of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ifs</code>. This alone  makes the code faster (in both rust and C++). Before leaving C++ behind, lets look at the performance with the margin algorithm.</p>

<p><strong>Many bombs:</strong></p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/minesweeper/time-array-compare-2.png" alt="tile" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Less bombs:</strong></p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/minesweeper/time-array-compare-8.png" alt="tile" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The speed gains in rust and C++ are similar. The C++-margin performance is close to the rust-baseline, striking.</p>

<p>I checked that the baseline get similar timing to the margin algorithm if I <a href="https://github.com/Julien5/sandbox/blob/master/test/rust/minesweeper/src/baseline-manipulated.rs">manipulate</a> it so to remove bound checking (I constrained the bomb positions to avoid edges). Then the timings are similar to the margin version.</p>

<p>OK, now <em>good bye C++</em>.</p>

<h2 id="going-parallel-with-tiles">Going Parallel with Tiles</h2>

<p>The idea is very simple: divide the large minesweeper grids into multiple small rectangular tiles (subgrids), as shown here:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: center"><img src="/assets/minesweeper/tiles.png" alt="tile" /></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: center">Tiles for N=6,K=3 =&gt; X=6, Y=2</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>If \(K\) is the number of tiles, each tile has dimension \((X+2)x(Y+2)\) where \(X=N\) and \(Y=N/K\).</p>

<p>When merging the tiles for printing, we must take properly care of those edges (this is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">merge</code> function in <a href="https://github.com/Julien5/sandbox/blob/master/test/rust/minesweeper/src/tile.rs">tile.rs</a>). This resulting algorithm is as follows:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Determine \(K\), the number of tiles. (This could be defined by the user.)</li>
  <li>For each k in \({0,...,K-1}\):
    <ul>
      <li>generate a chunk of \(B/K\) bomb positions.</li>
      <li>for each bomb chunk, create one tile, place the bombs and increment neighbors counts.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Aggregate the \(K\) tiles together and fix the counts on the tile edges.</li>
</ol>

<p>The loop at step 2 can be parallelized since the chunks and the tiles are indepedant from each other. Step 3 could be integrated in step 2, fixing the counts on the fly, immediately after the tiles have been produced. But this would require a mutex, and the <a href="https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/">rayon</a> has an <a href="https://github.com/rayon-rs/rayon/issues/592">issue</a> with using mutexes.</p>

<p>Implementation with explicit for loops:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>// Bchunk = B/K
fn main(X:usize,Y:usize,Bchunk:usize,K:usize,quiet:bool) {
	let mut tiles = Vec::new();
	for index in 0..K {
		let chunk=BombChunk::with_bomb_count(X,Y,index,Bchunk);
		tiles.push(make_tile(chunk));
	}
	let mut acc=TileAccumulator::init();
	for tile in tiles {
		acc.aggregate(tile);
	}
	// print ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first loop can be reformulated with iterators and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.map"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">map</code></a>:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>	let tiles:Vec&lt;Tile&gt;=(0..K).into_iter()
		.map(|index| {
			let chunk=BombChunk::with_bomb_count(X,Y,index,Bchunk);
			make_tile(chunk)
		}).collect();
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Thanks to the rayon crate, we just replace the standart iterator with <a href="https://docs.rs/rayon/latest/rayon/iter/index.html">parallel iterators</a> to generate bombs and make tiles concurrently:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>	let tiles:Vec&lt;Tile&gt;=(0..K).into_par_iter()
		.map(|index| {
			let chunk=BombChunk::with_bomb_count(X,Y,index,Bchunk);
			make_tile(chunk)
		}).collect();
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="performance-1">Performance</h3>

<p>The size of the grid is fixed to \(N=8 \times 1024\). The number of bombs is \(B=N^2/2\) and the number of chunks (or tiles) processed in parallel varies.</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/minesweeper/time-chunks.png" alt="tile" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Well, as expected, this is faster with more chunks. And it takes less memory!</p>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="/assets/minesweeper/space-chunks.png" alt="tile" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>This behavior likely occurs because bomb generation is distributed over time. For instance, if chunk 2 is processed first and chunk 3 is generated later, the memory allocated for chunk 2 is freed when chunk 3 begins allocating its own memory. As a result, the peak memory usage at any given moment decreases.</p>

<p>Generating bomb per tile has a “statistical” cost: the probability of the bomb distribution is not uniform over the large grid anymore. For example the probability of any chunk to have more (or less) than \(B/K\) bombs is zero. At this price we reduce the space complexity.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="minesweeper" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[In his essay On Writing, Stephen King advises writers to begin with a “situation” rather than a fully fleshed-out plot.
